notes - week twelve

## week 9 feedback

You’ve brought up some interesting points for the week. I appreciate your respect for basic knowledge when it comes to coding. It would be interesting to hear of some possible examples from your own work that might help to further highlight your points. I also agree with your analysis of replicability and reproducibility, and I wonder if any of this week’s readings have or have not influenced how you think of your own work, regarding the course assignments, in any way?

## week 10 feedback

Life of its own - yes. And even if it’s unlikely the original communities will spot what we have done online, we still owe an obligation to think this through - even if the ultimate goal is ‘mere’ educational.

Do you see any ways in which the tasks this week speak to these observations? Maybe in the ‘learning the past through doing’ observation you made?

Do you see any connections between what you’ve observed and the replicable research dimension?

**A note I shared with everyone re wk 10: this week’s snafus with the research compendium code only goes to show that when we’re on the cutting edge of digital archaeology, we sometimes get… cut. The complex links of dependencies (software packages that themselves depend on other software packages, all the way down…) means that we also have to think about ‘freezing’ our computer environments when we have something that works. One route for this is the creation of ‘containers’ using the Docker system; I considered doing this for the class but thought it wouldn’t be necessary. Clearly, I was wrong. Anyway, the creation of containers also helps us get around the problem of ‘it worked on my machine!’ because the act of creation pulls in the full code of all of the dependencies. My use of the Binder system isn’t how Marwick envisioned someone might use his ‘rrtools’ package (he imagined you’d install it on your own machine, and thus wouldn’t have to worry about certain issues that using Binder throws up). Suffice it to say, it all worked back in August, but of course, by the end of November something changed. This kind of thing happens all the time in digital archaeology; I’m sorry it happened to us during this week, but the important thing is not to lose sight of the main goal: making our research processes and data transparent and shareable. Rrtools was one way of doing this; there are others and at this point, with your knowledge of github, you are capable of devising other ways.

I like the engagement with nothing besides remains. As a procedurally generated archaeological world, by exploring it and encountering its various fragments you create a narrative about what happened: it is a simulation of archaeological experience, after a fashion. But at another level, at that of its rules, there is a model of how the world works. Can you discern what some of these rules might be? How could you do that? What might that imply for reuse/replicability in archaeology, or in communicating archaeological knowledge?

Good critique on zines. Fitzpatrick is herself subaltern in some respects; is there no space within academia for this kind of engagement/critique/activity? Zines certainly are not rewarded in academia incentive structures…

Re enchantment, it’s in direct opposition to the ‘disenchantment’ or the rationalization of western thought. But this, as we’ve seen, leads to a number of suboptimal or unintended or disastrous consequences when thinking about society. I’d encourage you to keep pulling on these threads - obviously, not in this course, as we’re out of time, but look up Jane Bennet and hey, even my own book on Enchantment, if you want to…

Re creative mindset - sounds a bit like you’re arguing for counterfactuals. Seeing as how you’ve already encountered ABMs - is there scope there?
