# Consolidation Document 3

>Discuss at least one ‘fail’ and one ‘win’. Explicitly situate your discussion with reference to the readings and annotations by the class as a whole. Again, as I asked at the end of Modules 1 and 2, in the context of the last few weeks, what has been most challenging win/fail for you, and why is that?

My fail for module 3 is in not taking enough time for the exercises in these final few weeks. The readings in week 11 were meant to be annotated by us students, but I had fallen behind that week and though I ended up catching up later, I felt like I potentially missed out on some discussion that could have happened because I ended up not making annotations because I knew that I was the last person in class looking at those readings. Furthermore, after peeking in the discord and seeing some of the sonification and other projects people were able to produce, I wish I had made more time to try out more of week 12's exercises myself.

My biggest win in module 3 has been being able to catch up again after falling behind on this course in week 11. I am glad to have been able to catch up and submit this consolidation document (relatively to my other ones) on time for the deadline.

The most challenging part of this last module for me has been reconciling two different view-points on the role of the creative mindset in digital archaeology, which I hope to have made clear by the end of this document (see the section Learning Art Through Doing).

>Given what you’ve read and explored in this last module, which was about ‘communicating’ digital archaeology, what are the implications for ‘doing’ digital archaeology for different audiences? How has your thinking evolved since the end of Module 2? Are there new dilemmas that have emerged?

### Archaeology of the Heart and Open Data

In their paper titled ["At the Heart of the Ikaahuk Archaeology Project," Lisa Hodgetts and Laura Kelvin](https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/hodgetts-kelvin.pdf) discuss a 'heart-centered approach' to archaeology:

>Through listening and trying to respond to the needs of community members in Sachs Harbour, my research has become less about reconstructing  past  lives  from  material  remains  and  more  about  working  with  community members  to  facilitate  their  access  to  their  archaeological  heritage  and  supporting them as they make meaning from those remains. It ows from my personal relationships with community members, which makes it a work of the heart, and it is about connecting them with things that have emotional and spiritual meaning and value for  them – things  of  the  heart.

I think it is worth considering whether we are taking a heart-centered approach towards the communities which the graveyards we recorded our data from serve. Are we ensuring that our interests align with their needs? To this question I would answer no because we are not really engaged in a dialogue with these communities, we are not keeping them updated on what we are doing with the data, and at the end of the day our use of the data is simply for our own educative enrichment. Is the best care being taken that our work will not harm these communities? Since we are using the data in quite limited ways and since our work is rarely published online, it is fairly unlikely that anything from this course will eventually be discovered by one of those communities' members by accidental chance. But we still have an obligation to those communities to not share or publish this data beyond reasonable bounds, because once data is put online it can very much take on a life of its own, and potentially fall into the hands of someone who does not take time to consider about the ethical consequences of using this data and how it may affect these communities.

It is important to consider this perspective of guarding data alongside so-called open data. The idea behind open data is that we should make data collected and used in studies available and freely accessible in order for the findings of these studies to be reproducible and therefore verifiable. In contrast to the point made above, one could argue that making data used in studies freely accessible ought to be an ethical imperative in itself, because if an argument is based upon some dataset which is unavailable, there is no way to verify the truth of it.

There is therefore a contention: do we guard data so that it does fall into the wrong hands and negatively affect the communities it is collected from or do we allow data to be freely available in order for it to be verifiable? The answer here is certainly something which is not necessarily easy and which should certainly be decided on a case-by-case basis. But most importantly, it need not be a binary decision since we can enforce varying levels of access to data. The Mukurtu heritage project is a good example of this: it is a heart-centered solution to the data sharing problem ([Hall, "Mukurtu for maatauranga Maaori: A case study in Indigenous archiving for reo and tikanga revitalisation](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/394945/chapter25.pdf)).

### Learning Through Doing and Archaeological Art

In [Hodgetts and Kelvin's "At the Heart of the Ikaahuk Archaeology Project"](https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/hodgetts-kelvin.pdf), they describe how the Ikaahuk, among other Indigenous communities, utilize a concept of learning through doing:

>Western academics study the past intellectually and know the past primarily in their minds. Community members from Sachs Harbour tell us that they learn about the past through doing, the same way they traditionally learned about most things (Kelvin 2016). Learning the past through doing means engaging one’s body and heart, as well as mind in the process. Betty Haogak told Laura that community members learn about the past “by living it”, and Kevin Gully explained that learning through doing involves “going to the source of history”. When they describe this concept of learning about the past through doing, community members are usually referring to “traditional” activities like sewing, hunting, trapping, and food preparation. By taking part in traditional activities, often on the land in places used by their ancestors, people experience and know the past in ways that cannot be learned through oral histories.

For me, the creative aspect of digital archaeology appears in this domain. A creative mindset can help us develop systems (stories, games, fiction) which allow people to 'learn through doing,' in a way, or as I put it at the end of module 2: "by putting [ourselves] in another's virtual shoes, [we] can gain a better understanding of the way they see their world and why they do the things they do." But at the end of week 11 I came off as skeptical about the artistic colouring in of the world of the past. Here, I would like to make clear this apparent contention and show how my ideas about artistic digital archaeology have evolved over the past four weeks.

The essence of history (at least for me) has to do with looking at the past, looking at artifacts, and developing abstract structures or systems, which we can call models, to interpret a rational order to these phenomena. In disseminating these models about the past it can sometimes help peoples' understanding if we use an artistic approach and fill in the blanks to help illustrate these models. We can create a story about the past with concrete characters and settings (which can be historically verifiable, somewhat historically verifiable, or fictional) in order to teach a model of understanding about a historical period and the people that lived in it. By seeing these psudo-historical phenomena recreated in an order which is intentionally built according to a model, it becomes easy for the reader to rebuild that model within their own mind, i.e. easier than going to the primary source material itself and interpreting it for themselves, and easier than going to the historical secondary sources, the 'proofs' of these models validities, and learning them that way. Video games can also be used like this, as can some ABM approaches. Overall, I think the artistic/creative approach to archaeology and history is useful for disseminating to the wider public because it can make history much more intuitive, interesting, and perhaps even fun.

But I think we ought to be weary because it can be a tricky game when we filling in the details according to models. When blending historical fact with fictional inventions to illustrate a model's point, it is not easy for the reader to tell this distinction. It is possible for the reader to over-interpret, to build their own model (which does not have historical validity) based in part on some of the invented elements of a story. For this reason, I think that these creative approaches should be mostly avoided in an academic setting. In the field of history we ought to keep building our models with historical artifacts as the premises.

Creating a simulation based on a model (like an ABM) involves tweaking with specific values which are left unquantified in the abstract model, and this can be considered a creative approach. A simulation like this can perhaps be useful in gauging the accuracy of the original abstract model by comparing it with the real archaeological/historical record, or in being used to illustrate a theoretical model in a more intuitive way (like a story). But I doubt that these ABMs have much predicative potential because they are so abstract and the material world is so incomprehensibly complex.

### Reproducibility and Research Compendiums

Archaeological work is destructive by its very nature. When an artifact is removed from the earth it was found in it is no longer the same - an artifact can only be found one time. For this reason, the traditional scientific conception of reproducibility cannot apply to archaeological phenomena, but once artifacts are abstracted into data and collected in databases, manipulations can be made on the data to bring out hidden patterns or qualities which do not appear on the surface. Since data can be easily copied so that an original version remains undisturbed, these manipulations can be reproduced by simply following the same set of instructions on a fresh copy of the data in order to validate the results.

On a computer this reproducibility is, in theory, as simple as copying the data and the code used to manipulate it, hitting 'run,' and comparing the results. In practice, its a little more complicated because of differences in machines and dependency versioning: the same piece of python code may run differently depending on the machine and operating system it was compiled on, the version of python being used, and the versions of any libraries that have been imported. Any one of these things may have been the reason we failed in reproducing Hope Loiselle's findings.

Thankfully, there are strategies which can be used to mitigate a lot of these issues, i.e. keeping track of which versions of the dependencies were used as well as the specifications of the machine the experiment was run on. These version numbers and machine specifications along with the original data and the code to manipulate it can all be packaged together in a research compendium, which can then be used to recreate the same conditions (by using a virtual machine and downloaded the same dependency versions) to validate the results of the experiment. [Ben Marwick et al. provide a very good article titled "Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)"](http://faculty.washington.edu/bmarwick/PDFs/Marwick-Boettiger-Mullen-2018-TAS-research-compendia.pdf) which explains the importance of using research compendiums and how to get started with creating one in R. But even so, putting together a research compendium is not a trivial task and there are still complications: we saw in week 10 how a tutorial for creating a research compendium no longer worked as intended because of some changes in its dependencies made over only a few months.
