Discuss at least one ‘fail’ and one ‘win’. Explicitly situate your discussion with reference to the readings and annotations by the class as a whole. Again, as I asked at the end of Modules 1 and 2, in the context of the last few weeks, what has been most challenging win/fail for you, and why is that?

fail --> 

win -->

challanging -->

Given what you’ve read and explored in this last module, which was about ‘communicating’ digital archaeology, what are the implications for ‘doing’ digital archaeology for different audiences? How has your thinking evolved since the end of Module 2? Are there new dilemmas that have emerged?
